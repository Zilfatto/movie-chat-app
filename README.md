# How to run the code

For this you need to have Node installed and run the following command - "npm install" (if you have already unbundle received .bundle file by running "git clone").
After that you need to run the next command - "npm start".
And that's it!

# Explanation of architecture

My project is built with Create React App.

I used function components in it.

## In my project I have different folders among which:
* "components" which contains components themselves and their styles (SASS files). Index files are needed for more convenient importing those components.

* "services" for different services like HTTP for fetching data or possible CRUD operations on it.

* "utils" for common and specific operations or actions which different components need. Because otherwise components files would be too big. 

## Libraries that I used:
* react - the backbone of my project
* @ant-design/icons - icons for better UX
* antd - for using built components
* axios - for fetching data
* firebase - for storing and manipulating data 
* lodash-es - a set of usefull functions
* moment - for working with dates
* moment-duration-format - help moments work with durations
* node-sass - it is not a library but a loader for using SASS in the ptojects.

# If you had more time, what would you like to improve?

I would:

## UX
* make my project look good on mobile devices.
* add some animations to an arrow for closing a modal and to new comments to make them appear more smoothly.
* make notifications much prettier (Could use react-toastify, but Ant design quite a big library).

## UI
* replace added comment after it came from DB (with id) or remove it from state, if an error occurred during saving it on the server

## Data structure
* store comments as a subcollections of movies documents or even put them in a separate collection (because I do not always need to load all the comments of all time).
* add genres to a separate entity in the database.
* add a timestamp to comments.

## General
* Optimize the bundle of Ant Design by adding "babel-plugin-import" into webpack. But for this I need to run "eject" command and project will become quite messy.
